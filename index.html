        <h1>What is the Monty Hall problem?</h1>
        <p>Imagine that you are in a game show. There are three doors behind one of which is a car. You pick a door. The host, who knows where the car is, is forced to reveal a different door, showing you there is nothing behind it. Now, the host asks if you would like to choose the other unopened door.</p>
        <h2>Should you switch or you stick with the one you chose?</h2>
        <p>The correct mathimatical answer is "YES" because if you switch, the odds will be 2/3 to have the car. If you don't switch, the odds will be 1/3. The probability locks in when you make the choice.</p>
